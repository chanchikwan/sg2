ihd is a simple 2D spectral hydrodynamic code written in CUDA C

CONVENTIONS: let u be the two dimensional velocity.  We define the
  stream function f such that

    u = curl(f).

  In component form, we have ux = df/dy, uy = -df/dx.  It is fine that
  we do not distinguish between the scalar f and the vector (0, 0, f)
  in this README file.  The vorticity is defined as

    w = curl(u).

  Similarly, we do not distinguish between w or (0, 0, w).  It is
  clear that the stream function and the vorticity satisfy the
  following Possion equation:

    w = - grad^2 f,

  or, in the Fourier space,

    W_k = k^2 F_k.  (*)

  We will use nu to denote the kinematic viscosity, mu be the Ekman
  coefficient.  We will also use

    J(f, w; x, y) = (df/dx)(dw/dy) - (dw/dx)(df/dy)

  to denote the Jacobian determinant.

EQUATION: from equation (*), it is clear that W_k falls off slower
  than F_k.  For a pseudospectral (or collocation) method, it is
  better to solve the vorticity equation

    dw/dt - J(f, w) = nu grad^2 w - mu w,

  instead of the stream function equation because of the finite
  precision in the fast Fourier transforms.

  For Galerkin spectral method, we keep track of the Fourier modes in
  stead of the functions.  This allows easy implementation of implicit
  or semi-implicit integrators for the linear terms.  Although
  evolving the stream function does not reduce accuracy in Galerkin
  spectral method, we will stick with the vorticity equation.

TIME-STEP: The stability condition for the explicit (advection) step
  is u dt < 3.34 / K.  Using K = n / 3, we have

    dt u n < 10.0

  The stability condition for the implicit (diffusive) step is
  1 - 0.5 dt (alpha[i+1] - alpha[i]) (nu K^2 + mu) >= 0.  Because
  max(alpha[i+1] - alpha[i]) ~ 0.336 for 4th-order Runge-Kutta/Crank-
  Nicolson, we have

    dt (nu n^2 / 9 + mu) < (2 / 0.336) ~ 5.95

  The overall stable time step is the smaller one.

FORCING: we implemented two kinds of forcings.  One is determinated
  Kolmogorov forcing, and the other one is random forcing at a given
  wavenumber.  Both forcing terms are implemented in force.cu.

  For the Kolmogorov forcing, we use the following equation:

    f_K(x, y) = fi ki cos(ki x)

  where fi and ki are paramters describing the amplitue and wavenumber
  of the forcing.  This forcing is integrated explicitly in the
  low-storage 4th-order Runge-Kutta method.

  For random forcing, we use

    f_r(x, y) = fi ki exp[i (kix x + kiy y)] / sqrt(dt)

  and update the vorticity at the end of each Runge-Kutta (full) step.
  The update is only 1st order in time.  The randomness comes in
  because of a phase and the direction of ki.

ENERGY AND ENSTROPHY TRANSFER: the non-linear energy transfer (rate)
  is one of the most important quantities in turbulence theories.  In
  two dimension, the energy inversely cascades to large scale; while
  the enstrophy forward cascades to small scale.  We should compute
  both of them.

  Let's write the two dimensional Navier-Stokes equation in Fourier
  space as

    (d/dt + mu + nu k^2) u_k = NL_k

  where NL denotes the non-linear and pressure terms.  Using "*" to
  denote complex conjugate, we can easily write down the energy
  trasfer through each mode

    T(k) = (d/dt + 2 mu + 2 nu k^2) u_k*.u_k = u_k*.NL_k

  Because we evolve the vorticity equation in this code, it is easier
  to compute the enstrophy transfer instead:

    T_Z(k) = (d/dt + 2 mu + 2 nu k^2) w_k* w_k = w_k* J_k

  We can now use the following relation to obtain the energy transfer

    T(k) = - T_Z(k) / k^2.

  The energy flux Pi(k) and the enstrophy flux Pi_Z(k) are given by

    d/dk Pi  (k) = T  (k),
    d/dk Pi_Z(k) = T_Z(k).
