ihd is a simple 2D spectral hydrodynamic code written in CUDA C

CONVENTIONS: let u be the two dimensional velocity.  We define the
  stream function f such that

    u = curl(f).

  In component form, we have ux = df/dy, uy = -df/dx.  It is fine that
  we do not distinguish between the scalar f and the vector (0, 0, f)
  in this README file.  The vorticity is defined as

    w = curl(u).

  Similarly, we do not distinguish between w or (0, 0, w).  It is
  clear that the stream function and the vorticity satisfy the
  following Possion equation:

    w = - grad^2 f,

  or, in the Fourier space,

    W_k = k^2 F_k.  (*)

  We will use nu to denote the kinematic viscosity.  We will also use

    J(f, w; x, y) = (df/dx)(dw/dy) - (dw/dx)(df/dy)

  to denote the Jacobian determinant.

EQUATION: from equation (*), it is clear that W_k falls off slower
  than F_k.  For a pseudospectral (or collocation) method, it is
  better to solve the vorticity equation

    dw/dt - J(f, w) = nu grad^2 w,

  instead of the stream function equation because of the finite
  precision in the fast Fourier transforms.

  For Galerkin spectral method, we keep track of the Fourier modes in
  stead of the functions.  This allows easy implementation of implicit
  or semi-implicit integrators for the linear terms.  Although
  evolving the stream function does not reduce accuracy in Galerkin
  spectral method, we will stick with the vorticity equation.
